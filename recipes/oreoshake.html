    <h2>How to make an oreo shake</h2>

    <p>Milkshakes are a classic American frosty treat. A creamy combination of ice cream and milk, they're served at diners and dairy shops, including fast-food favorites like Dairy Queen, Burger King, and Sonic. And while they're a delicious treat to order alongside your burger, you can easily make them at home and save a few dollars. All you need are a few simple ingredients and a blender.</p>

    <p>Super-thick milkshakes are often typically made with a milkshake machine, the kind of contraption typically reserved for restaurants. If you happen to have one at home, you can reduce the amount of milk in this recipe and use it instead of a blender—just break up the Oreos and add them at the end of mixing. Otherwise, a good blender will do the trick and break up the cookies for you.</p>
    

    <p>If your blender is hardworking, try adding half the milk to start, adding more as needed to make it blend. This will make a thicker shake. If you're in a pinch and need to use water to make this milkshake instead of milk, you can—it just won't be nearly as creamy as you might like.
                     <p></p>
        With a bit of cookie crunch, rich chocolate sauce, and creamy texture, it's no wonder that people are so fond of this flavorful Oreo milkshake. Serve with a colorful straw.</p>
