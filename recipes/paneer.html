    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    
    <ol>

        <li> Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients. It’s time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, and slicing paneer into cubes.</li>

        <li>To make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1 inch piece of peeled ginger with 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside.        </li>

        <li> After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews to a blender or mixer-grinder.</li>

        <li> Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste from the blender and set it aside.</li>

        <li>In the same blender, add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes.</li>

        <li>Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside. Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the heat to a low or medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons (or 3 to 4 tablespoons for a richer version) butter in a pan. Either salted or unsalted butter can be used.</li>

        <li>Keep the the heat to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta and fry for 2 to 3 seconds, or until fragrant. Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready-made ginger-garlic paste.</li>

        <li>Sauté until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears, about 10 to 12 seconds Pour in the prepared tomato purée.</li>

        <li>Mix it very well with the butter.Begin to cook the tomato purée on a low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals.The tomato purée mixture will start simmering.</li>

        <li> If the tomato purée splutters too much while cooking, then cover the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter guard (channi lid). Continue stirring occasionally. Simmer the purée for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder or deghi mirch.
            You can also opt to add just ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder, or ¼ – ½ teaspoon of cayenne, paprika or any other variety of red chilli powder that you prefer.Mix well and continue to stir and sauté the tomato purée.</li>

        <li>Sauté till the butter starts leaving the sides of the pan and the entire tomato purée mixture comes together as more of a thick paste.</li>

        <li>Now add the prepared cashew paste.Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and continue to stir and sauté on a low to medium-low heat.</li>

        <li>Sauté until the cashew paste is cooked and the oil begins to leave the sides of the masala. The cashew will cook quickly, just around 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat. And don’t forget to keep on stirring non-stop!</li>

        <li>Next add 1.5 cups water.Mix the water very well with the tomato-cashew masala. If there are lumps, then break them with a spoon or use a wired whisk for mixing.Let the curry simmer and come to a boil on a low to medium-low heat. Stir occasionally.        </li>

        <li>After 2 to 3 mins, add ginger julienne (about 1-inch ginger – cut in thin, matchstick-like strips). Reserve a few for garnishing. The curry will begin to thicken.After 3 to 4 minutes, add 1 or 2 slit green chiles.</li>

        <li> Also add salt to taste and, if necessary, ¼ to 1 teaspoon sugar depending on the sourness of the tomatoes.Mix very well and simmer for a minute. After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes (200 or 250 grams).</li>

        <li>Stir and mix the paneer cubes gently in the gravy. You can switch off the heat at this point.Now quickly add 1 teaspoon crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi leaves) and 1 teaspoon garam masala to the gravy.</li>

        <li> Next add 2 to 3 tablespoons of low-fat or light cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream. </li>

        <li>Stir gently but well. If you haven’t yet, switch off the heat.</li>

    </ol>
