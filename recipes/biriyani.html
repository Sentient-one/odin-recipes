    <h3><strong>Chicken biryani</strong> is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</h3>



    <p>                   &nbsp;        Whether you're talking Arroz con Pollo, Hainanese Chicken Rice, or Oyako Donburi, chicken and rice is a classic pairing that has permeated culinary culture around the world. It makes sense that earlier in human history, this staple grain would be combined with a domesticated source of protein. Still, the fact that this combination has endured as a popular favorite today, speaks to its unassailable deliciousness. It even inspired me to create this Chicken Coconut Rice recipe.</p>

    <p>                  For my Chicken Biryani recipe, I've simplified the preparation a bit by marinating the chicken in a spicy mixture of garam masala, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, coriander leaves, and garlic. When fried, the spices and aromatics on the exterior of the chicken caramelize into an insanely flavorful crust. I like to make the fried onions separately, as it allows you to fully caramelize them into a sweet umami-packed layer that contrasts the spicy, savory chicken. For the rice, a quick par-boil with whole spices like cardamom, bay leaves, and cumin infuses some flavor, while ensuring the rice is tender enough steam after the Biryani is assembled.

    <h5>Preparation</h5>
    <b>Gather all ingredients</b>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>

        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>

        <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li>

        <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</li>

        <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>

        <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</li>

        <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
